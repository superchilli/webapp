===============
Flask-Bootstrap
===============

Flask-Bootstrap packages `Twitter's Bootstrap
<http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_ into an extension that mostly consists
of a blueprint named 'bootstrap'. It can also create links to serve Bootstrap
from a CDN and works with no boilerplate code in your application.

Usage
-----

Here is an example::

  from flask.ext.bootstrap import Bootstrap

  [...]

  Bootstrap(app)

This makes some new templates available, containing blank pages that include all
bootstrap resources, and have predefined blocks where you can put your content.

As of version 3, Flask-Bootstrap has a `proper documentation
<http://pythonhosted.org /Flask-Bootstrap>`_, which you can check for more
details.
